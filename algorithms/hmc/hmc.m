%% Hamiltonian MC using Neal's 5th Chapter of the "Handbook of MCMC"

% Heavily inspired on Radford N. Neal's chapter "MCMC using
% Hamiltonian Dynamics" (from the "Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo")

% Distribution of the momentum variables:
% - ï»¿"We can choose the distribution of the momentum variables, p, which 
% are independent of q, as we wish, specifying the distribution via the 
% kinetic energy function, K(p). Current practice with HMC is to use a 
% quadratic kinetic energy, as in Equation 5.5, which leads p to have a 
% zero-mean multivariate Gaussian distribution. Most often, the components
% are specified to be independent. So you retrieve the energy function in
% equation 5.23"

%  Input arguments:
%     - U: function which returns the potential energy given a value for q
%     - grad_U : returns the vector of partial derivatives of U given q
%     - epsilon: stepsize for leapfrog steps
%     - L : number of leapfrog steps in the trajectory
%     - current_q : current position that the trajectory starts from
%     - mu, Sigma: moments of the distribution of p (which is often assumed gaussian)
