        % "Parallel tempering: Theory, applicationas, and new perspectives."
        % In this article and in the article by ï»¿Fukunishi et al., it is
        % assumed that beta, the inverse temperature (approx.) stays the
        % same for all replicas.
        
        %  If I don't assume beta to the same for all and derive the
        %  equations myself, I get:
        beta = temp.^(-1);
        initial_config = beta(ii)*(current_U(ii)+current_K(ii)) + beta(kk)*(current_U(kk)+current_K(kk));
        
        % Define proposed Hamiltonians
        proposed_config = beta(ii)*(current_U(kk)+current_K(kk)) + beta(kk)*(current_U(ii)+current_K(ii));
        
        alpha = min(1, exp(proposed_config - initial_config));
        
        if alpha > rand()
            samples{ii}{iter+1} = samples{kk}{iter+1};
